This graph doesn&apos;t contain any self-loops or multiple edges. Self-loop is an edge connecting a vertex to itself. Multiple edges are a pair of edges such that they connect the same pair of vertices. Since the graph is undirected, the pair of edges $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 1)$$$ is considered to be multiple edges.

So minimum number of isolated vertices is $$$max(0, n - 2m)$$$.</p><p>To calculate maximum number of isolated vertices let&apos;s keep number of non-isolated vertices knowing that each pair connected by edge (i.e. size of clique). Let we have size of clique $$$cur$$$ and $$$rem$$$ edges remained unassigned at current step. If $$$rem = 0$$$ then answer is $$$n - cur$$$. Otherwise we need to increase clique with one vertex. Maximum number of edges we can add to connect this vertex is $$$add = min~(rem, cur)$$$. So, subtract it from $$$rem$$$ and increase $$$cur$$$ by one. Repeat this step while $$$rem$$$ greater than zero. Answer is $$$n - cur$$$.</p><p>One corner case is next: if $$$cur = 1$$$, then answer is $$$n$$$, not $$$n - cur$$$.</p></div>"}
